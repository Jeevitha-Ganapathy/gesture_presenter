# gesture_presenter
Gesture Presenter is an interactive system that allows users to control PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures instead of a keyboard or mouse. It leverages MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and computer vision techniques to detect predefined gestures, enabling smooth slide navigation and hands-free interaction.
